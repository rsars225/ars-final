# ars-final
Welcome to my final  digital art repository! Please take a second to read through this before proceeding with viewing all attached files.

Note: Of the 8 points requested in the description of the final assignment, only three will be included in this GitHub. Theses three points are as follows:

- data set 
- art references
- photo documentation of the artwork itself
   
The remaining points will all be answered in the pdf attached on Brightspace.

Of the files attached in this repository, the main "dataset" includes the two Ai images generated, the one real footage of the recent CEO shooting, the final visual poetry on page five (which was made on a separate website), as well as a huge compilation of AI generated text from original sources (98% of which ended up not being used).

Though there weren't many visual artistic references, my main sources of inspiration were the novels I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, as well as Dune, snippets of which were used in the txt file attached. Lauren Holden was also used as isnpiration for some of the visual poetry formatting, based on the link that was attached on my last feedback, and three examples of her own work have been included. Lastly, the final project itself is a five slide pdf.
